# 🌐 Open Lab Agents

## Vision
Open Lab Agents is a decentralized framework that empowers educators and learners to create, issue, and collect **digital learning badges** on-chain — a bridge between academic achievement and Web3 technology.

Our goal is to make educational recognition transparent, portable, and verifiable — from classrooms to the metaverse.

## 🚀 Roadmap

### Phase 1 – Prototype (Today)
- Deploy test contracts on Remix (Ethereum or Polygon testnet)
- Connect badges to IPFS metadata
- Build simple React frontend for minting badges

### Phase 2 – Pilot
- Launch in classrooms (grades 3–5 STEM projects)
- Create automation workflows (n8n or Zapier) to track badge creation
- Onboard educators via OpenLab portal

### Phase 3 – Scale
- Integrate AI Tutor & Verification Agents
- Support interoperability with Learning Record Stores (LRS)
- Launch DAO governance for educators
